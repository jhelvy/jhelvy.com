We find that with the combined bundle of attributes offered by vehicles available today, gasoline vehicles continue in both countries to be most attractive to consumers, and American respondents have significantly lower relative willingness-to-pay for BEV technology than Chinese respondents. While U.S. and Chinese subsidies are similar, favoring vehicles with larger battery packs, differences in consumer preferences lead to different outcomes. Our results suggest that with or without each country’s 2012–2013 subsidies, Chinese consumers are willing to adopt today’s BEVs and mid-range PHEVs at similar rates relative to their respective gasoline counterparts, whereas American consumers prefer low-range PHEVs despite subsidies. This implies potential for earlier BEV adoption in China, given adequate supply. While there are clear national security benefits for adoption of BEVs in China, the local and global social impact is unclear: With higher electricity generation emissions in China, a transition to BEVs may reduce oil consumption at the expense of increased air pollution and/or greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, demand from China could increase global incentives for electric vehicle technology development with the potential to reduce emissions in countries where electricity generation is associated with lower emissions.\nRecommended Citation:\nHelveston, J.P., Liu, Y., Feit, E.M., Fuchs, E.R.H., Klampﬂ, E., & Michalek, J.J.

SP data is often treated with suspicion because consumers may respond differently in a hypothetical survey context than they do in the marketplace. However, models built on RP data can suffer from endogeneity bias when attributes that drive consumer choices are unobserved by the modeler and correlated with observed variables. Using a synthetic data experiment, we test the performance of pooled RP–SP models in recovering the preference parameters that generated the market data under conditions that choice modelers are likely to face, including (1) when there is potential for endogeneity problems in the RP data, such as omitted variable bias, and (2) when consumer willingness to pay for attributes may differ from the survey context to the market context. We identify situations where pooling RP and SP data does and does not mitigate each data source’s respective weaknesses. We also show that the likelihood ratio test, which has been widely used to determine whether pooling is statistically justifiable, (1) can fail to identify the case where SP context preference differences and RP endogeneity bias shift the parameter estimates of both models in the same direction and magnitude and (2) is unreliable when the product attributes are fixed within a small number of choice sets, which is typical of automotive RP data. Our findings offer new insights into when pooling data sources may or may not be advisable for accurately estimating market preference parameters, including consideration of the conditions and context under which the data were generated as well as the relative balance of information between data sources.\nRecommended Citation:\nHelveston, J.P., Feit, E.M., & Michalek, J.J.

We study consumer preferences for combustion fuels including gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) using consumer choice survey data from two settings: online (n = 331) and in-person at refueling stations (n = 127). Light-duty vehicle owners were asked in a series of choice tasks to choose among fuels that varied in type, price, CO2 emissions, and location of origin for a hypothetical vehicle that could accept all fuels. We find that the majority of gasoline and E85 users are willing to substitute towards other fuels at today’s prices and attributes, while diesel users have a strong preference for diesel fuel. We also find that respondents are willing to pay on average $150/ton CO2 avoided from fuel consumption—more than most estimates of the social cost of carbon. Thus, communicating the climate benefits from alternative fuels may be an important strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector.\nRecommended Citation:\nHelveston, J.P., Seki, S., Min, J., Fairman, E., Boni, A.A., Michalek, J.J., & Azevedo, I.

We apply inductive, grounded theory-building techniques to examine what prompts firms to experiment across one emerging technology platform—plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)—in China. Triangulating annual vehicle make and model sales data from 2003 to 2016 (plus monthly data from 2010 to 2016); 112 English and Mandarin archival documents from industry, academic, and news outlets; and 51 semi-structured interviews with industry, government, and academic stakeholders, we develop four in-depth case studies. We find that in contrast to the innovation trajectories of multinational and Chinese arms of joint venture (JV) firms, independent domestic Chinese firms (those with no history of international JV partnerships) are undertaking significant experimentation across multiple levels—infrastructure, core system, subsystem, and component—of the emerging PEV technology platform. We propose the concept of “institutional complementarities” to describe how interactions among institutions—here the national JV regulation and local market support and subsidies—may have turned regional markets into protected laboratories, extending the incubation periods for independent domestic firm experimentation. While this diverse experimentation may be an important antecedent of technology transition, consolidation induced by national policy standardization or competitive pressure may be required for PEV innovations to scale beyond their early, protected regional markets.\nRecommended Citation:\nHelveston, J.P., Wang, Y., Karplus, V.J., & Fuchs, E.R.H.

It will also require collaboration with China, which has emerged as the global leader in the mass production of low-carbon energy technologies (LCETs). In part because of China’s investments in manufacturing, the LCETs required to meet climate targets have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuel sources (1). But some attribute China’s rapid rise in LCET sectors to unfair industrial policies—such as forced technology transfer requirements, massive subsidies, and outright intellectual property (IP) theft—aimed at strategically dominating the next generation of energy technologies (2). Trade relations between China and the world are currently unsettled, especially with the United States, a leading producer of both LCET research and development (R&D) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Against this backdrop, we outline why engaging with China is the more promising path to accelerate the global deployment of LCETs and to rapidly bring new technologies to mass production.\nRecommended Citation:\nHelveston, John P. & Nahm, Jonas (2019) “China’s key role in scaling low-carbon energy technologies” Science. 366(6467), pg. 794-796.

Prior research has found that direct experience with PEVs increases consumers’ stated purchase consideration, but these studies have used relatively long exposure times (days to months) with a PEV. To assess the effect of shorter exposure times (e.g. minutes) on stated purchase consideration, we conducted an experiment at the 2019 Washington D.C. Auto Show. Participants (n = 6518) were asked to rate their level of consideration to adopt a PEV before and after riding in one of four different PEVs for just 3–5 min. We find that the experience of riding in a PEV on average had a significant, positive effect on participants’ consideration ratings. We also find that the vast majority of respondents were unable to correctly answer basic knowledge questions about refueling a PEV and federal subsidies available for purchasing a PEV. These results suggest that while consumer knowledge about PEVs remains low, short rides or drives in a PEV could be an effective, more scalable strategy for increasing PEV consideration across larger populations.\nRecommended Citation:\nRoberson, Laura A. & Helveston, John P.

EAF enables decision makers to explore alternative transition paths, thus providing several multi-step options to achieve a desired end state. These multi-step transition paths can be particularly valuable when they mitigate the impact of system degradation during the deployment of new capabilities. Additionally, EAF is formulated in a manner that empowers decision makers to apply decision variables, such as a cost cap or an equity metric, which are increasingly relevant to modern decision-making. To demonstrate the method and its value, we apply the EAF to a case study inspired by Los Angeles’ Vision 2028. We identify 26 transition paths across different performance dimensions. We model the cost and performance of each transition pathway and compare them using multiple measures, including traditional benefit-cost metrics and differential impacts on different stakeholder groups. Our results show that multi-step paths outperform single-step transitions to an end state (“big bang” approaches) in most scenarios. Multi-step paths also provide valuable alternatives when particular stakeholders value non-cost metrics.\nRecommended Citation:\nSzajnfarber, Z., Groover, J.A., Wei, Z., Broniatowski, D.A., Chernicoff, W., & Helveston, J.P.

Using a national conjoint survey (N = 2,170 respondents), we quantify how U.S. vehicle buyers value different features of PEV financial incentives. Participants overwhelmingly prefer immediate rebates, on average valuing them by $580, $1,450, and $2,630 more than sales tax exemptions, tax credits, or tax deductions, respectively. These effects are significantly larger for lower-income households, used vehicle buyers, and buyers with lower budgets. We estimate that on average $2 billion could have been saved if the federal subsidy available between 2011 and 2019 were delivered as an immediate rebate instead of a tax credit, or $1,440 per PEV sold. Our results suggest that structuring incentives as immediate rebates would deliver a greater value to customers and would be more equitably distributed compared to the current tax credit scheme.\nRecommended Citation:\nRoberson, Laura A. & Helveston, John P.

Here we assess the cost savings from a globalized solar photovoltaic (PV) module supply chain. We develop a two-factor learning model using historical capacity, component and input material price data of solar PV deployment in the United States, Germany and China. We estimate that the globalized PV module market has saved PV installers US$24 (19–31) billion in the United States, US$7 (5–9) billion in Germany and US$36 (26–45) billion in China from 2008 to 2020 compared with a counterfactual scenario in which domestic manufacturers supply an increasing proportion of installed capacities over a ten-year period. Projecting the same scenario forwards from 2020 results in estimated solar module prices that are approximately 20–25 per cent higher in 2030 compared with a future with globalized supply chains. International climate policy benefits from a globalized low-carbon value chain, and these results point to the need for complementary policies to mitigate welfare distribution effects and potential impacts on technological crowding out.\nRecommended Citation:\nHelveston, J.P., He, G., & Davidson, M.R.

Although CVs, HEVs, and PHEVs are driven similarly, BEV cars average 4,477 fewer miles annually. Teslas are driven more than other BEVs, yet still less than CVs. Similar differences in VMT across powertrains exist for SUVs, though SUVs are driven more than cars in all powertrains. Driving range has a non-linear relationship with VMT for BEV cars: every 10 additional miles of range equates to 631 additional annual miles for low-range BEVs (<100 miles of range) but only 85 annual miles for high-range BEVs (>200 miles of range). BEV cars also show less sensitivity in annual VMT to operating cost changes compared with CVs. Results provide an important context for modelers anticipating increased electricity consumption from PEV adoption.\nRecommended Citation:\nZhao, L., Ottinger, E., Yip, A., & Helveston, J.P.

The package is faster than other similar packages such as mlogit, gmnl, mixl, and apollo, and it supports utility models specified with “preference space” or “willingness to pay (WTP) space” parameterizations, allowing for the direct estimation of marginal WTP. The typical procedure of computing WTP post-estimation using a preference space model can lead to unreasonable distributions of WTP across the population in mixed logit models. The paper provides a discussion of some of the implications of each utility parameterization for WTP estimates. It also highlights some of the design features that enable logitr’s performant estimation speed and includes a benchmarking exercise with similar packages. Finally, the paper highlights additional features that are designed specifically for WTP space models, including a consistent user interface for specifying models in either space and a parallelized multi-start optimization loop, which is particularly useful for searching the solution space for different local minima when estimating models with non-convex log-likelihood functions.\nRecommended Citation:\nHelveston, John P.

For transportation system simulations to produce realistic results, modelers need to incorporate these users and their choices. Choice-based conjoint surveys provide an attractive solution for obtaining flexible utility models that can be used to predict choices for a wide variety of trips. In this study, we demonstrate an example using conjoint survey data of commuter mode choice in the Washington, D.C. metro area (N = 1,651). We sample commuters who primarily drive and those that take transit. We examine preferences for different types of multi-modal trips, including those with intramodal and intermodel transfers. We find that trips involving a bus transfer are the least preferred while both drivers and transit users both value metro similarly to driving. We also find that walking during transit trips is an important barrier, with the travel time penalty for walking being 60% higher than that of time in a vehicle. Our findings highlight the significance of accounting for differences in modal transfer types in transportation system simulations. Reducing arrival time uncertainty was not a significant factor in commuter mode choice, and commuters’ value of time was similar across all vehicle types, suggesting that increasing the relative speed of transit modes may only have a marginal effect on commuter substitution away from personal vehicles.\nRecommended Citation:\nZhao, L., Szajnfarber, Z., Broniatowski, D.A., & Helveston, J.P.
