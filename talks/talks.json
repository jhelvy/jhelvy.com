You can watch the recording below.\nAbout the webinar:\nThe auto industry is on the cusp of its greatest transformation in more than a century, shifting from internal combustion engines to electric motors powered by lithium-ion batteries. China, which already plays an important role in global auto supply chains, has been the first mover in this transformation, sparking concerns in the United States and elsewhere. This session will explore the United States‚Äô proposed response to this challenge and its profound links to both long-run economic prosperity and the future of the planet.\nModerator: John Paul Helveston, Assistant Professor, Engineering Management & Systems Engineering, George Washington University\nAdministration Presenter: Susan Helper, Senior Economist, White House Council of Economic Advisers\nDiscussants:\nGeorge W.

The surveys are all generated from Google sheets, which can be found here:\nRandom images demonstrates how to randomly display different images.\nConjoint surveys demonstrates how to create a conjoint survey with formr (go to the formr4conjoint repo for a more detailed description)\nTimed quizzes demonstrates how to create a timed quiz with randomly generated questions.\nTo use any of these surveys yourself, go to formr.org, create an account. Once you log in, go to the admin page and create a new survey. You can then paste in the link to the Google sheet there. If you want to edit it, just create copy of the Google sheet into your own Google Drive account and use the shared link to that Google sheet.\nOnce you have a survey uploaded, you can make it live by creating a ‚ÄúRun‚Äù and inserting the survey you created by clicking on the icon as well as a ‚ÄúStop‚Äù point to end the survey by clicking on the icon. The link to the survey will be https://your_run_name.formr.org.\nYou can control the ‚Äúpublicness‚Äù of the survey by modifying the ‚Äúvolume‚Äù icons:\nmeans only you can access the survey\nmeans you and people who have an access code can access (no new users can enroll).\nmeans people who have the link can access.\nmeans the link is public, everyone can access.\n\n\n\n",
