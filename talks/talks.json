You can see that below (the first 5 minutes is the same as my rstudio::conf lightning talk):\n\n\nSlides\nHere are my slides for my rstudio::conf lightning talk built using the {xaringan} R package. You can also see the source code for the slides here.\n\n Full screen slides Slides as PDF\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts for Slides:\nUse ← and → to navigate through the slides.\nUse f to toggle full screen.\nUse o to view an overview of all slides.\nUse h to see a list of other shortcuts.\n\n\n\nfitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});\n\nSurveys with {formr}\nIn my presentation, I showed several examples of how to use the {formr} package to create different types of surveys. The surveys are all generated from Google sheets, which can be found here:\nRandom images demonstrates how to randomly display different images.\nConjoint surveys demonstrates how to create a conjoint survey with formr (go to the formr4conjoint repo for a more detailed description)\nTimed quizzes demonstrates how to create a timed quiz with randomly generated questions.\nTo use any of these surveys yourself, go to formr.org, create an account. Once you log in, go to the admin page and create a new survey. You can then paste in the link to the Google sheet there. If you want to edit it, just create copy of the Google sheet into your own Google Drive account and use the shared link to that Google sheet.\nOnce you have a survey uploaded, you can make it live by creating a “Run” and inserting the survey you created by clicking on the icon as well as a “Stop” point to end the survey by clicking on the icon. The link to the survey will be https://your_run_name.formr.org.\nYou can control the “publicness” of the survey by modifying the “volume” icons:\nmeans only you can access the survey\nmeans you and people who have an access code can access (no new users can enroll).\nmeans people who have the link can access.\nmeans the link is public, everyone can access.\n\n\n\n",
