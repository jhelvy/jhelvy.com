### Welcome to my personal website!
I am a researcher, engineer, musician, swing dancer, and an Assistant Professor at George Washington University in the [Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering](http://emse.seas.gwu.edu/). I study technological change, with a focus on accelerating the transition to environmentally sustainable and energy-saving technologies. Check out my [about](about.html) page for more about me, and explore the site menu to view my [blog posts](blog.html) or find out more about my [research](highlights.html) and [teaching](teaching.html).

### John Paul Helveston, Ph.D.
John Paul Helveston is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering](http://emse.seas.gwu.edu/) at the George Washington University. He studies technological change, with a particular interest in accelerating the transition to environmentally sustainable and energy-saving technologies. His research centers around how consumer preferences, market dynamics, and policy affect the emergence of critical technologies, such as electric vehicles and solar energy. He is an expert on China's rapidly emerging electric vehicle industry as well as the critical relationship between the US and China in developing and mass producing low carbon energy technologies. He applies an interdisciplinary approach to research, with expertise in discrete choice modeling and conjoint analysis as well as interview-based case studies. He has conducted extensive fieldwork in China, collaborating with colleagues at Beijing Normal University and China's State Information Center on past projects. He is a fluent speaker of Mandarin Chinese and also an award-winning swing dancer. John holds a Ph.D. and M.S. in Engineering and Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon University and a B.S. in Engineering Science and Mechanics from Virginia Tech."
