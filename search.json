I am a researcher, engineer, choice modeler,  developer, musician, swing dancer, and an Assistant Professor at George Washington University in the Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering. I study technological change with a focus on accelerating the transition to low-carbon technologies like electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies. You can also see more about my background on my CV and Resume:\n\n\nResume\nCV\n\n\nShort Bio\nJohn Paul (JP) is an Assistant Professor at George Washington University in the Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering. His research focuses on understanding how consumer preferences, market dynamics, and policy affect the emergence and adoption of low-carbon technologies, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies. He also studies the critical relationship between the US and China in developing and mass producing these technologies. He has expertise in discrete choice modeling, conjoint analysis, exploratory data analysis, interview-based research methods, and the R programming language. He speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese and has conducted extensive fieldwork in China. He is also an accomplished violinist and swing dancer. John holds a Ph.D. and M.S. in Engineering and Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon University and a B.S. in Engineering Science and Mechanics (ESM) from Virginia Tech.\n\nI use  for most of my quantitative research projects. One specific category of research is choice modeling. I use choice-based conjoint surveys to measure people’s preferences for a variety of technologies and policies. I have developed several packages for implementing conjoint in , including {logitr} for estimating multinomial and mixed logit models with preference space and “willingness-to-pay” space utility parameterizations, and {cbcTools} for designing and conducting power analyses for choice-based conjoint surveys.\nIn addition to choice modeling, I teach multiple programming and data analytics courses in , and all of my course materials are built using , including course websites and slides. I also co-authored the {renderthis} package with Garrick Aden-Buie for rendering media (e.g., xaringan slides) into multiple different formats.\nYou can see more of my  projects and source code on my GitHub page: https://github.com/jhelvy/\nChina & 中文\nJohn standing next to a Beijing roast duck mascot in Beijing in 2014I began studying Chinese during my second year as an undergraduate engineering student at Virginia Tech in the fall of 2006. The next spring, I received the Horton Scholarship, which provided a unique opportunity to travel to China and complete an educational project of my own design. I traveled to Dalian in the summer of 2008 to study language and culture at Liaoning Normal University, then I moved to Shanghai in the fall to gain international engineering experience as an intern in General Electric’s Advanced Wind Turbine Operations division. The project opened my eyes to the many forces that shape the adoption of emerging technologies, in particular the importance of policy and economics. After returning to the U.S., I was awarded a Critical Language Scholarship by the U.S. Department of State to study Chinese in Harbin, China during the summer of 2009, and I have since returned to China numerous times for work or research, including an internship at the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation (iCET) and as a 2014 East Asia Pacific Summer Institutes (EAPSI) Fellow supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation. Today, I continue to use my language skills and experience in China while conducting interdisciplinary research in China.\nSwing Dancing\nJohn swing dancing in Beijing in 2016Many of my closest friends know me first and foremost as a dancer. In the fall of 2006, I attended my first swing dance hosted by the Virginia Tech Swing Club Soley Swing, and swing dancing quickly became a major part of my life. I dance Lindy Hop, Balboa, Blues, and Charleston, and my dancing adventures have brought me to cities all over the world, including New York, Montreal, Boston, Washington D.C., Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, Pusan, Osaka, Taipei, and even on the Great Wall of China. Sharing the joy of swing dancing with friends and strangers all over the world is one of my greatest passions. I have competed internationally as a dancer, and my most accomplished achievement is winning 1st place in the Open Strictly Lindy Hop competition with my good friend Annabel Truesdell Quisao at the 2011 International Lindy Hop Championship in Washington, D.C.\nMusic\nJohn with his partner and violin after a concert at CMU in 2016Music was my earliest passion. I grew up playing piano, violin, and mandolin, and I have had the privilege of studying and performing with some incredible musicians. In high school I had the honor of studying violins with the legendary Dora Marshall Mullins of Virginia Beach, VA, and I have played in multiple ensembles, including the Virginia Beach Symphony Orchestra (now “Symphonicity”), the New River Valley Symphony at Virginia Tech, the National Taiwan Normal University Symphony, and the All University Orchestra at Carnegie Mellon University. I am also a self-taught mandolinist and guitarist and enjoy playing jazz and bluegrass. I have fortunately had many opportunities to play with some wonderful jazz friends, including the Muddy Basin Ramblers (a New Orleans-style jazz band in Taipei) and the Hot Club of Beijing (a gypsy swing band based in China’s capital).\nThanks for visiting my site, and I am grateful for any feedback you may have!\nCheers,\nJohn (章乐汉)\n\n\n\n",

Last Updated: 2024-01-31\nIf you have questions about the EMSE track, contact Prof. John Paul Helveston\nIf you have questions about the CS track, contact Prof. Tim Wood\n\nImportant: for student who started BEFORE Fall 2022: This page reflects the new DA MS course requirements for students starting in Fall 2022 or later. If you are on the old program, then you should check this Pre-2022 DA MS FAQ.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the recommended sequence for full-time students?\nSemester 1:\nCSCI 6444 Introduction to Big Data and Analytics\nEMSE 6765 Data Analysis for Engineers and Scientists\nEMSE 6574 Programming for Analytics\n\nSemester 2:\nEMSE 6586 Data Management Systems for Data Analytics\nFirst Required Track Course\nCS Track: CSCI 6212 Design and Analysis of Algorithms\nEMSE Track: EMSE 6575 Applied Machine Learning for Analytics\nElective\n\n\nSemester 3:\nSecond Required Track Course\nCS Track: CSCI 6364 Machine Learning\nEMSE Track: EMSE 6577 Data-Driven Policy\n\nElective\nElective\n\nSemester 4:\nSEAS 6402 Data Analytics Capstone\n\nThis leaves your final semester light on course work, which many students find helpful as they apply for jobs and can focus their time on interview preparation.\nNOTE: The above schedule is optimized for students starting in a fall semester. If you begin in spring, EMSE 6574 is usually not offered. If you are in the CS track, we recommend taking CSCI 6212 instead, or if you are in the EMSE track you can pick an EMSE course without prerequisites to take as an elective.\nWhat is the recommended sequence for part-time students taking 6 credits a semester?\nSemester 1:\nCSCI 6444 Introduction to Big Data and Analytics\nEMSE 6574 Programming for Analytics\n\nSemester 2:\nEMSE 6765 Data Analysis for Engineers and Scientists\nEMSE 6586 Data Management Systems for Data Analytics\n\nSemester 3:\nFirst Required Track Course (CSCI 6212 or EMSE 6575)\nElective\n\nSemester 4:\nSecond Required Track Course (CSCI 6364 or EMSE 6577)\nElective\n\nSemester 5:\nElective\nSEAS 6402 Data Analytics Capstone\n\nCan you help me understand the overall degree requirements?\nThe full requirements in the Bulletin are:\nComplete the five Required Courses\nComplete two Required Track courses for your focus area (CSCI 6212 and CSCI 6364 or EMSE 6575 and EMSE 6577)\nComplete one more Elective course in your track’s department at the 6000+ level\nComplete two additional electives. These can be 6000+ courses from any department, but if they are outside of CS or EMSE, then you need to get approval from your advisor first.\nDo I need to take CSCI 6362 Probability for Computer Science as a Prerequisite for CSCI 6364 Machine Learning?\nNo. This is not required as long as you have a statistics/probability course at the undergraduate level. Taking EMSE 6765 Data Analysis for Engineers and Scientists will also meet this need.\nHow many courses do I need in my focus area (CS or EMSE)?\nYou must take at least 3 courses in the track you have selected – two are required and the third is any of your choice from that department.\nCan I take course X which is not listed in the degree requirements?\nIf it is a 6000 level course, then generally yes it can be one of your two unrestricted electives. You should contact your advisor for approval first.\nYes, but you will need to fill out the CS Department’s Registration help form. Contact your advisor or cs@gwu.edu for more information.\nCan the SEAS 6402 DA Capstone course only be taken in Spring semesters?\nThe course is typically only offered in the spring, though some years we also offer a smaller fall section. You should not take 6402 until you have completed the other four required courses. If you start the program in Spring, then we recommend taking it in your 3rd semester (i.e., your second spring, a semester before graduation). If you are not able to take the course at the normal time, you should consult with your advisor before your last semester about completing the capstone as an independent project.\nI want to register for a 6000 level course, but I’m restricted, how do I register?\nSome courses have restrictions on who can register for a variety of reasons. Often times the restriction is due to missing prerequisite courses or the course is only offered to majors in that field (e.g. most courses in DATS are restricted to DATS majors). In these cases, you typically need to fill out an RTF form. Here are some details:\nFor EMSE courses: Fill out an RTF and send it to Professor Helveston for approval.\nFor CSCI courses: Go to the CS Department’s Registration help form and fill out the request form. Dr. Tim Wood will take care of processing the request.\nFor any other course: Fill out an RTF and send it to the course instructor for approval. In these cases (especially if it’s a course outside of SEAS), also include a message as to why you want to enroll in the course.\nIn general, if there are prerequisite issues preventing you from registering, also explain in your email why you should be exempt from the prerequisite (e.g. you have prior experience or have taken a similar course, etc.).\nI’m interested in becoming a Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant, how can I apply for one of these positions?\nGTA (teaching assistantship) positions are limited and typically offered to students later in the program (e.g. year 2) to GTA for a course they’ve already taken in their first year. There are not many of these available, and many are prioritized for PhD students over MS students since PhDs have longer tenures in SEAS (4-5 years) and because many will be in academic settings in their careers and therefore need more teaching experience. The best advice for these positions is to do an excellent job in the classroom and discuss with each faculty member you take a course with that has a GTA to see if you could take on a GTA position in the future. Directly expressing your interest to the faculty is the best thing you can do.\nGRA (research assistantship) positions are typically arranged on a faculty-by-faculty basis and usually supported by external research funding. The best way to find opportunities is to reach out to individual faculty and ask if there are potential GRA positions in their lab. It is also best to read up on the faculty member you are reaching out to to make sure their lab focuses on a topic that you are interested in and have something to offer. This isn’t limited to SEAS - you could be a GRA for a professor in a different school, and it is not strange for a DA student to use their skills in other domains, such as public health, the Elliott School, etc. Again, directly reaching out to faculty members is the best advise for obtaining one of these positions.\nI am looking for an internship or job in Data Analytics / Data Science, what should I do?\nFirst, reaching out to SEAS career services is a good idea. And it is also a good idea to get on Linkedin and get your CV / Resume setup so employers can find you.\nBeyond these channels, you can also significantly improve your chances of getting a position by networking with people in the DC area. For example, attend some of the Data Science DC meetups. Many of the participants are data professionals in the greater DC area and may know of a company hiring. You can also network online. Linkedin sometimes works, but joining Slack communities can also be a helpful way to connect with people. The R for Data Science community, for example, has a very active Slack that you can join that is open to the public. While it is more focused on R, they often post general jobs that are not language-specific.\nFinally, I would also recommend reading the book Build a Career in Data Science. The authors have many great suggestions and answer a lot of important questions about searching for and successfully finding a job in this field.\n\n\n\n",

Topics covered include fundamentals of programming (operators, data types, objects, functions, conditionals, loops, strings, testing, and debugging) as well as techniques for working with data sets in R and Python (file input/output, data structures, data wrangling, data visualization, external packages, and reproducible reporting). Emphasis will be on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Students will primarily work on individual programming assignments to develop skills in computational problem solving, writing code, and working with data. Students will be assessed through quizzes, homework assignments, and exams. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of time spent live coding and working on practice problems in class. This course assumes no prior programming experience and is an ideal preparation for higher level courses in data analytics.\n\nSemesters Taught:\nSpring 2023\nSpring 2022\nFall 2020\nFall 2019\n\n\n\nEMSE 4572: Exploratory Data Analysis\nThis course provides students with a foundation in exploring data using the R programming language. Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using RMarkdown. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings.\n\nSemesters Taught:\nFall 2022\nSpring 2021\nSpring 2020\n\n\n\nEMSE 6035: Marketing of Technology\nThis course provides students with data analysis techniques to inform design decisions in an uncertain, competitive market; topics include consumer choice modeling, programming in the R programming language, survey design, conjoint analysis, optimization, market simulation, and professional communication skills. Over the course of the semester, students will learn and apply theory and methods to a team project to assess the market competitiveness of an emerging product / technology and use marketing analytics to generate design insights. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute presentation of their findings. This course has a “flipped” classroom structure. Students will spend the majority of class time working through guiding practice exercises or working on their projects. To prepare for class, students must complete weekly assignments that involve watching and reviewing recorded lecture materials and answering related practice questions.\n\nSemesters Taught:\nFall 2022\nFall 2021\nSpring 2019\n\n\n\nR for Analytics Primer\nA self-guided tutorial for developing a foundation in programming in R for data analysis, including data input/output, data wrangling, and data visualization using the Tidyverse.\n\n\n\n\n",
