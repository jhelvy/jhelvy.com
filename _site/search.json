I am a researcher, engineer, musician, swing dancer, and an Assistant Professor at George Washington University in the Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering.\nI study technological change, with a focus on accelerating the transition to environmentally sustainable and energy-saving technologies. My research centers around how consumer preferences, market dynamics, and policy affect the emergence of critical technologies, such as electric vehicles and solar energy. I also study the critical relationship between the US and China in developing and mass producing low-carbon energy technologies. I apply a variety of methods, including discrete choice modeling, conjoint analysis, exploratory analysis, and interview-based case studies. I speak fluent Mandarin Chinese and have conducted extensive fieldwork in China, collaborating with colleagues at Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, and the State Information Center on past projects. Below is a short description of some of my other passions and hobbies.\nChina & 中文\nJohn standing next to a Beijing roast duck mascot in Beijing in 2014I began studying Chinese during my second year as an undergraduate engineering student at Virginia Tech in the fall of 2006. The next spring, I received the Horton Scholarship, which provided a unique opportunity to travel to China and complete an educational project of my own design. I traveled to Dalian in the summer of 2008 to study language and culture at Liaoning Normal University, then I moved to Shanghai in the fall to gain international engineering experience as an intern in General Electric’s Advanced Wind Turbine Operations division. The project opened my eyes to the many forces that shape the adoption of emerging technologies, in particular the importance of policy and economics. After returning to the U.S., I was awarded a Critical Language Scholarship by the U.S. Department of State to study Chinese in Harbin, China during the summer of 2009, and I have since returned to China numerous times for work or research, including an internship at the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation (iCET) and as a 2014 East Asia Pacific Summer Institutes (EAPSI) Fellow supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation. Today, I continue to use my language skills and experience in China while conducting interdisciplinary research in China.\nSwing Dancing\nJohn swing dancing in Beijing in 2016Many of my closest friends know me first and foremost as a dancer. In the fall of 2006, I attended my first swing dance hosted by the Virginia Tech Swing Club Soley Swing, and swing dancing quickly became a major part of my life. I dance Lindy Hop, Balboa, Blues, and Charleston, and my dancing adventures have brought me to cities all over the world, including New York, Montreal, Boston, Washington D.C., Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, Pusan, Osaka, Taipei, and even on the Great Wall of China. Sharing the joy of swing dancing with friends and strangers all over the world is one of my greatest passions. I have competed internationally as a dancer, and my most accomplished achievement is winning 1st place in the Open Strictly Lindy Hop competition with my good friend Annabel Truesdell Quisao at the 2011 International Lindy Hop Championship in Washington, D.C. You can see more on my page about dancing.\nMusic\nJohn with his partner and violin after a concert at CMU in 2016Music was my earliest passion. I grew up playing piano, violin, and mandolin, and I have had the privilege of studying and performing with some incredible musicians. In high school I had the honor of studying violins with the legendary Dora Marshall Mullins of Virginia Beach, VA, and I have played in multiple ensembles, including the Virginia Beach Symphony Orchestra (now “Symphonicity”), the New River Valley Symphony at Virginia Tech, the National Taiwan Normal University Symphony, and the All University Orchestra at Carnegie Mellon University.\nI am also a self-taught mandolinist and guitarist and enjoy playing jazz and bluegrass. I have fortunately had many opportunities to play with some wonderful jazz friends, including the Muddy Basin Ramblers (a New Orleans-style jazz band in Taipei) and the Hot Club of Beijing (a gypsy swing band based in China’s capital).\nThanks for visiting my site, and I am grateful for any feedback you may have!\nCheers,\nJohn (章乐汉)\n\n\n\n",

Her research interests include electric vehicle adoption, innovation developments and policies that promote innovations. She also has 8+ years working for a global automotive manufacturer, giving her a balance of academic and industry knowledge and experience. Laura received her BS in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Virginia Tech and her MS in Systems Engineering from the great GWU EMSE department.\n\n          Leah KaplanLeah is a Ph.D. student in the Systems Engineering Program at the George Washington University and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. Leah graduated summa cum laude with her Bachelor’s in chemical engineering from the University of Arizona before moving to DC to pursue an interest in science policy. Leah interned with the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and worked for the Arizona State University Consortium for Science, Policy & Outcomes. Leah’s primary research interest is decision-making under uncertainty related to emerging technologies, with a focus on transportation. She aims to understand how we can leverage technologies for the benefit of, rather than detriment to, society.\n\n          Lujin Zhao (赵鲁晋)Lujin is a Ph.D. student in the Systems Engineering Program at the George Washington University. Lujin received a B.S. in Agricultural and Resources Economics from University of Maryland, a M.S. degree in Economics from Tufts University, and a M.S. degree in Data Analytics from the George Washington University. His interests are China’s EV subsidy policies, environmental impacts from the EV industry, and energy policy. For the past several years, he has been living in the DC area and I really enjoy the summertime here except for that during June, July and August.\n\nMasters Students\n\n\n          Saurav PanthaSaurav is a graduate student from Kathmandu, Nepal and is currently earning his MS in Systems Engineering at The George Washington University (GW). Before GW, he worked at a business consulting firm based out of Bangalore, India, helping multiple automotive & banking clients to solve business problems through data analytics solutions. Within Dr. Helveston's lab, he has been supporting multiple research projects by setting up a pipeline for a MySQL database, writing R scripts to clean & wrangle data, and conducting literature surveys. When not in school, he loves to go on treks and watch Manchester United's soccer games live.\n\nUndergraduate Students\n\n\n          Amelia JacquatAmelia is a sophomore at The George Washington University. Originally from New Orleans, LA, she is pursuing a Bachelors degree in Systems Engineering at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. She is also pursuing minors in Computer Science and Theatre. After graduation, she plans on pursuing her Masters degree in Systems Engineering. Amelia is excited to continue learning and growing as a researcher and young professional. She plans on using this valuable research experience in her future endeavors, whatever they may be.\n\n          Helena RoweHelena is an undergraduate student from Marblehead, Massachusetts majoring in Systems Engineering and minoring in Sustainability at The George Washington University. In previous roles, she has worked for a small consulting firm, analyzed market research for a building materials start-up, and researched with a professor about climate change risks in the investment industry. Within Dr. Helveston's lab, she is researching electric vehicle (EV) sales forecasts over time from different organizations. She is seeking to better understand the uncertainty in these forecasts and trends over time, in relation to actual sales, and across different industries.\n\n\n\n\n",
