I prepared an "Elevator Pitch" (aka lightning talk) for the [2021 useR! Conference](https://user2021.r-project.org/) where I discussed a quick overview of software and hardware solutions for more ergonomic typing. The recording and slides are below. 

See also my related [blog post](https://www.jhelvy.com/posts/2021-07-03-in-search-of-keyboard-nirvana/) for more details on the topics covered in the talk.
