I gave a talk at the Sawtooth Software Conference [Turbo Choice Modeling Seminar](https://events.sawtoothsoftware.com/turboseminar) in San Antonio, Texas, April 19-23, 2021 (I pre-recorded my talk as I did not attend in-person). The talk is titled, "The [{logitr}](https://jhelvy.github.io/logitr/) R Package: Obtaining Willingness to Pay Estimates from Preference Space and Willingness to Pay Space Utility Models".

Learn more about the {logitr} package [here](https://jhelvy.github.io/logitr/).
