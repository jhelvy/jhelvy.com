[Energy density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density) refers to how much energy can be stored in a given amount volume. This concept is frequently confused with [_specific energy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_energy), which is about how much energy can be stored per _unit of mass_. Both of these concepts are important for batteries --- a central technology enabling a future free of fossil fuels.

Gasoline has an energy density of about [12.7 kWh / kg](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ArthurGolnik.shtml). The best Li-ion batteries in today's EVs have an energy density of about [0.25 kWh / kg](https://insideevs.com/news/342679/tesla-model-3-2170-energy-density-compared-to-bolt-model-s-p100d/) --- about 50 times less dense as gasoline by mass!

While mass is an important factor, _size_ is perhaps more significant for the automotive domain as there is a limited amount of space to put batteries in a passenger vehicle. A gallon of gasoline is about 6.2 pounds, or 2.8 kg. Since there are 3.8 L per gallon, the _volumetric_ energy density of gasoline is about 12.7 / (3.8 * 2.8) = `r round(12.7 / (3.8 * 2.8), 1)` kWh / liter. Estimates of modern EV batteries are around 0.5 - 0.7 kWh / liter --- about half the energy density of gasoline by volume.

When I first made this calculation, I was quite surprised. I've always known that batteries are far less dense than most liquid fossil fuels, but I never realized how similar they were by _volume_. While Li-ion EV batteries are ~50x less dense than gasoline by mass, they are only about _half_ the energy density of gasoline by volume. This means that in the same amount of space in a vehicle gas tank, you could only store about half the amount of energy in a similarly sized Li-ion battery (not 1 / 50th, as is sometimes believed). But that battery would weigh a whole lot more than the gasoline --- 30x more to be precise.
