Electrifying the passenger vehicle fleet is a central goal of most climate plans, and energy storage is the central technology that will define the competitiveness of electric vehicles (EVs) with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). On most performance metrics, EVs are strictly better than ICEVs --- they can accelerate far faster, have a lower center of gravity, and they handle better in most driving situations. But EVs can't drive as far as a ICEV in between refuelings, and refueling an EV can be slow. Even "fast" charging an EV can take 20 to 30 minutes to get just another 100 miles or so of range, whereas an ICEV can get several hundred miles of range in under 5 minutes.

The limiting factor here is the energy density of EV batteries. [Energy density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density) refers to how much energy can be stored in a given amount volume. Energy density is often confused with [_specific energy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_energy), which refers to how much energy can be stored per _unit of mass_. Both of these concepts are important for EV batteries, but energy density is arguably the bigger limiting factor for automotive energy storage as there is a limited amount of space inside a vehicle to store energy.

The specific energy of gasoline is about [12.7 kWh / kg](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ArthurGolnik.shtml). A gallon of gasoline is about 6.2 pounds, or 2.8 kg. Since there are 3.8 L per gallon, the volumetric energy density of gasoline is about 12.7 / (3.8 * 2.8) = `r round(12.7 / (3.8 * 2.8), 1)` kWh / liter. Estimates of modern EV batteries are around [0.5 - 0.7 kWh / liter](https://insideevs.com/news/342679/tesla-model-3-2170-energy-density-compared-to-bolt-model-s-p100d/) --- about half the energy density of gasoline by volume.

This means that to store the amount of energy in a gallon of gasoline, an EV battery would need to be about twice the size of the gallon of gasoline. That isn't necessarily a problem though as EVs have more space to work with compared to ICEVs.




The best Li-ion batteries in today's EVs have an energy density of about [0.25 kWh / kg](https://insideevs.com/news/342679/tesla-model-3-2170-energy-density-compared-to-bolt-model-s-p100d/) --- about 50 times less dense as gasoline by mass!

While mass is an important factor, _size_ is perhaps more significant for the automotive domain as there is a limited amount of space to put batteries in a passenger vehicle.

When I first made this calculation, I was quite surprised. I've always known that batteries are far less dense than most liquid fossil fuels, but I never realized how similar they were by _volume_. While Li-ion EV batteries are ~50x less dense than gasoline by mass, they are only about _half_ the energy density of gasoline by volume. This means that in the same amount of space in a vehicle gas tank, you could only store about half the amount of energy in a similarly sized Li-ion battery (not 1 / 50th, as is sometimes believed). But that battery would weigh a whole lot more than the gasoline --- 30x more to be precise.
