### Welcome to my personal website!

I am a researcher, engineer, musician, swing dancer, and an Assistant Professor at George Washington University in the [Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering](http://emse.seas.gwu.edu/). I study technological change, with a focus on accelerating the transition to environmentally sustainable and energy-saving technologies. Check out my [about](about.html) page for more about me, and explore the site menu to view my [blog posts](blog.html) or find out more about my [research](highlights.html) and [teaching](teaching.html).
