Home page for my [personal website](https://jhelvy.github.io/), built
using the [{distill}](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) package.

This is still a work in progress.

Go to [jhelvy.com](http://www.jhelvy.com/) to see my more up-to-date
personal website, which will eventually all be moved to this repo.
